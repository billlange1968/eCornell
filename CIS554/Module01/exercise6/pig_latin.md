# Review the Rules of Pig Latin
The second function encodes English words into pig latin. Some of you may know this toy language from childhood. If you don’t, the rules are as follows:
The vowels are 'a’, 'e’, 'i’, 'o’, 'u’, as well as any ‘y’ that is not the first letter of a word. All other letters are consonants.
1. If the English word begins with a vowel, append ‘hay’ to the end of the word to get the Pig Latin equivalent. For example, ‘ask’ becomes ‘askhay’
2. If the English word starts with 'q’, assume ‘u’ is the second letter and move ‘qu’ to the end of the word. Then append 'ay’. So ‘quiet’ becomes 'ietquay’.
3. If the English word begins with a consonant, find the first vowel. Move all letters before this to the end and add 'ay’. For example, ‘tomato’ becomes ‘omatotay’ and ‘ssssh’ becomes 'sssshay’.
